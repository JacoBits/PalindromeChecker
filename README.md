# Sentences and Words
This repo is for code is meant to check words and sentences for specific concepts.

Palindrome.cpp checks if the input is a palindrome (spelled the same forwards and backwards).
PalindromeStack.cpp is palindrome.cpp but using a stack implementation. (WIP)
Grams.cpp checks if the input is a heterogram (has only 1 of each letter used), an isogram (has the same number for each letter used), and a pangram (has all the letters in the alphabet).
